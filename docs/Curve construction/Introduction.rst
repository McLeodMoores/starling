Curve Construction in the Analytics Library
===========================================

There are several examples of curve construction available

    * `A simple example of constructing a single curve<https://github.com/McLeodMoores/starling/blob/master/docs/Curve%20construction/Single-curve%20example.rst>`_. Introduces the basic ideas behind curve construction.
    * `Constructing OIS and LIBOR curves<https://github.com/McLeodMoores/starling/blob/master/docs/Curve%20construction/Multi-curve%20example.rst>`_. Shows how to construct multiple curves at once and demonstrates the difference between simultaneous and consecutive construction.
    * `Constructing multiple curves with and without convexity adjustment<https://github.com/McLeodMoores/starling/blob/curve/docs/Curve%20construction/EONIA%20and%20Euribor%20curve.rst>`_. Shows how to construct multiple curves using different models.
    * `Constructing curves with user-supplied nodes<https://github.com/McLeodMoores/starling/blob/master/docs/Curve%20construction/ECB%20meeting%20date.rst>`_. Shows how to construct curves using ECB meeting dates as the curve nodes.
