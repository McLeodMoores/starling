 * A position and a trade are related concepts and this interface provides common access.

 * A {@link Trade} stores details of an individual trade and refers to a quantity of a security.

 * Since both hold a quantity of a security, it can be useful to refer to both in a common way.

 * The reference to a security is held primarily by an identifier bundle.
 * However, this can become resolved, setting the security field with the full data.
