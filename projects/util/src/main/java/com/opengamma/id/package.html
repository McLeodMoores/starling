  <p>Defines the identification scheme used by all OpenGamma entities.</p>
  <p>All objects are lazily bound at runtime meaning no database primary/foreign keys are held for most object references, using these loose identifiers instead. This allows assembling of complex structures from multiple underlying sources.</p>
  <p>The three main identifier classes are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>UniqueId</strong>: The OpenGamma unique reference that is fully versioned</li>
  <li><strong>ObjectId</strong>: The OpenGamma object reference that is the base for the unique identifier over time</li>
  <li><strong>ExternalIdBundle</strong>: A set of real-world identifiers that may not be unique, and may change over time</li>
  <li><strong>ExternalId</strong>: A single real-world identifier, consisting of a scheme and value, such as "CUSIP~912828LS7" or "EDOL1~B53H5J6"</li>
  </ul>
