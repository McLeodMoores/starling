  <p>Defines the market data abstraction used by the OpenGamma engine to access any required market data.</p>
  <p>Dependency graph building works with a market data availability provider to determine when a graph is fully
  constructed. If a value can be provided from market data then this will be used; otherwise the dependency graph
  builder will attempt to find a function which can produce the value, and this may require further inputs.</p>
